   cd personal-web
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components (Hero, Navbar, etc.)
├── context/        # React Context (e.g., Loading state)
├── data/           # Structured data for projects and content
├── pages/          # Route components (Landing, Design, Engineering, etc.)
└── App.tsx         # Main application entry point

## 📦 Build for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate static assets in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

## 🎨 Design System

The project uses a clean, minimalist design language with:
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono (for code/technical feel) & Press Start 2P (for retro accents).
- **Color Palette**: A neutral backdrop with project-specific accent colors to highlight individual works.
